Create an empty folder "lab_02" with following structure:

```bash
lab_02
├── part_a
└── part_b
```

1. Copy your "src" folder from "a_bouncing_spheres" to the new "part_a" folder.

2. Copy your "shaders" and "src" folders from "b_water_droplet" to the new "part_b" folder.

Now the folder structure should look like

```bash
lab_02
├── part_a
│   └── src
└── part_b
    ├── shaders
    └── src
```

3. Compress the "lab_02" folder to "lab_02.zip" file and submit it.
